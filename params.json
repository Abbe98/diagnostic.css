Inspired by Eric Meyer's diagnostic CSS file, this one is intended to flesh out accessibility related issues on a page.  \r\n\r\n## How to use ##\r\nIf you're working with a site you own, add this (temporarily, of course) to your site to display the errors.\r\n\r\nIf you're checking work you don't have access to, use this as a user style. \r\n\r\n## Roadmap ##\r\nIn the future, I hope to add some generated content to better inform where/ what the problems are.\r\n\r\n## Make it better ##\r\nThis is an open repo. Contribute to it, add to the documentation, submit an issue, etc.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
